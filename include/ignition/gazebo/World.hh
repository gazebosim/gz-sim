    /// \brief This class provides wrappers around entities and components
    /// which are more convenient and straight-forward to use than dealing
    /// with the `EntityComponentManager` directly.
    /// All the functions provided here are meant to be used with a world
    /// entity.
    ///
    /// For example, given a world's entity, to find the value of its
    /// name component, one could use the entity-component manager (`ecm`)
    /// directly as follows:
    ///
    ///     std::string name = ecm.Component<components::Name>(entity)->Data();
    ///
    /// Using this class however, the same information can be obtained with
    /// a simpler function call:
    ///
    ///    World world(entity);
    ///    std::string name = world.Name(ecm);
