    /// \class Server Server.hh ignition/gazebo/Server.hh
    /// \brief The server instantiates and controls simulation.
    ///
    /// ## Example Usage
    ///
    /// A basic simulation server can be instantiated and run using
    ///
    /// ```
    /// ignition::gazebo::Server server;
    /// server.Run();
    /// ```
    ///
    /// An SDF File can be passed into the server via a ServerConfig object.
    /// The server will parse the SDF file and create entities for the
    /// elements contained in the file.
    ///
    /// ```
    /// ignition::gazebo::ServerConfig config;
    /// config.SetSdfFile("path_to_file.sdf");
    /// ignition::gazebo::Server server(config);
    /// server.Run();
    /// ```
    ///
    /// The Run() function accepts a few arguments, one of which is whether
    /// simulation should start in a paused state. The default value of this
    /// argument is true, which starts simulation paused. This means that by
    /// default, running the server will cause systems to update but some
    /// systems may not update because paused == true. For example,
    /// a physics system will not update its state when paused is
    /// true. So, while a Server can be Running, simulation itself can be
    /// paused.
    ///
    /// Simulation is paused by default because a common use case is to load
    /// a world from the command line. If simulation starts running, the
    /// GUI client may miss the first few simulation iterations.
    ///
    /// ## Services
    ///
    /// The following are services provided by the Server.
    /// The <world_name> in the service list is the name of the
    /// simulated world.
    ///
    /// List syntax: *service_name(request_msg_type) : response_msg_type*
    ///
    ///   1. /world/<world_name>/scene/info(none) : ignition::msgs::Scene
    ///     + Returns the current scene information.
    ///
    ///   2. /gazebo/resource_paths/get : ignition::msgs::StringMsg_V
    ///     + Get list of resource paths.
    ///
    ///   3. /gazebo/resource_paths/add : ignition::msgs::Empty
    ///     + Add new resource paths.
    ///
    /// ## Topics
    ///
    /// The following are topics provided by the Server.
    /// The <world_name> in the service list is the name of the
    /// simulated world.
    ///
    /// List syntax: *topic_name : published_msg_type*
    ///
    /// 1. /world/<world_name>/clock : ignition::msgs::Clock
    ///
    /// 2. /world/<world_name>/stats : ignition::msgs::WorldStatistics
    ///   + This topic is throttled to 5Hz.
    ///
    /// 3. /gazebo/resource_paths : ignition::msgs::StringMsg_V
    ///   + Updated list of resource paths.
