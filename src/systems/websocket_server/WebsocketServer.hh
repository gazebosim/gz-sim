    /// # Websocket Server Interface
    ///
    /// The websocket server listens for incoming requests and sends
    /// messages based on the requests.
    ///
    /// All messages on the websocket, incoming and outgoing, are structured
    /// in a frame that consists of four comma separated components:
    ///     1. `operation`: string,
    ///     2. `topic_name`: string,
    ///     3. `message_type`: string, and
    ///     4. `payload`: serialized data.
    ///
    /// The `operation` component is mandatory and must be one of:
    ///     1. "sub": Subscribe to the topic in the `topic_name` component,
    ///     2. "pub": Publish a message from the Gazebo Transport topic in
    ///               the `topic_name` component,
    ///     3. "topics": Get the list of available topics,
    ///     4. "topics-types": Get the list of available topics and their
    ///                        message types,
    ///     5. "protos": Get a string containing all the protobuf
    ///                  definitions, and
    ///     6. "particle_emitters": Get the list of particle emitters.
    ///                  definitions.
    ///     7. "unsub": Unsubscribe from the topic in the `topic_name` component
    ///     8. "asset": Get a file as a byte array from a running Gazebo
    ///                 server. Set the payload to the file URI that is
    ///                 being requested.
    ///     9. "worlds": Get world info.
    ///     10. "scene": Get scene info.
    ///     11. "image": Subscribe to an image in the `topic_name` component.
    ///     12. "throttle": Throttle a topic in the `topic_name` component by
    ///                 the rate in the `payload` component.
    ///     13. "req": Request a service, passing in the optional request
    ///                message. The payload should be a serialized
    ///                protobuf message. The response payload holds the
    ///                serialized protobuf response, if any.
    ///
    /// The `topic_name` component is mandatory for the "sub", "pub", "unsub",
    /// and "req" operations. If present, it must be the name of a Gazebo
    /// Transport topic.
    ///
    /// The `message_type` component is mandatory for the "pub" and "req"
    /// operations. If present it names the Gazebo Message type, such as
    /// "gz.msgs.Clock".
    ///
    /// The `payload` component is mandatory for the "pub" and "req"
    /// operations. If present, it contains a serialized string of a
    /// Gazebo Message.
    ///
    /// ## Example frames
    ///
    /// 1. Get the list of topics: `topics,,,`
    ///
    /// 2. Get the protobuf definitions: `protos,,,`
    ///
    /// 3. Subscribe to the "/clock" topic: `sub,/clock,,`
    ///
    /// 4. Websocket server publishing data on the "/clock" topic:
    ///    `pub,/clock,gz.msgs.Clock,<serialized_data>`
    ///
    /// # Example usage
    ///
    /// ## Websocket Server
    ///
    /// 1. Add the following to the top of an SDF file to include the websocket
