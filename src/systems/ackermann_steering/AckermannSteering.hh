  /// \brief Ackermann steering controller which can be attached to a model
  /// with any number of left and right wheels.
  ///
  /// # System Parameters
  ///
  /// `<left_joint>`: Name of a joint that controls a left wheel. This
  /// element can appear multiple times, and must appear at least once.
  ///
  /// `<right_joint>`: Name of a joint that controls a right wheel. This
  /// element can appear multiple times, and must appear at least once.
  ///
  /// `<left_steering_joint>`: Name of a joint that controls steering for
  ///  left wheel. This element must appear once.  Vehicles that steer
  ///  rear wheels are not currently correctly supported.
  ///
  /// `<right_steering_joint>`: Name of a joint that controls steering for
  ///  right wheel. This element must appear once.
  ///
  /// `<wheel_separation>`: Distance between wheels, in meters. This element
  /// is optional, although it is recommended to be included with an
  /// appropriate value. The default value is 1.0m.
  ///
  /// `<kingpin_width>`: Distance between wheel kingpins, in meters. This
  /// element is optional, although it is recommended to be included with an
  /// appropriate value. The default value is 0.8m.  Generally a bit smaller
  /// than the wheel_separation.
  ///
  /// `<wheel_base>`: Distance between front and rear wheels, in meters. This
  /// element is optional, although it is recommended to be included with an
  /// appropriate value. The default value is 1.0m.
  ///
  /// `<steering_limit>`: Value to limit steering to.  Can be calculated by
  /// measuring the turning radius and wheel_base of the real vehicle.
  /// steering_limit = asin(wheel_base / turning_radius)
  /// The default value is 0.5 radians.
  ///
  /// `<wheel_radius>`: Wheel radius in meters. This element is optional,
  /// although it is recommended to be included with an appropriate value. The
  /// default value is 0.2m.
  ///
  /// `<odom_publish_frequency>`: Odometry publication frequency. This
  /// element is optional, and the default value is 50Hz.
  ///
  /// '<min_velocity>': Minimum velocity [m/s], usually <= 0.
  /// '<max_velocity>': Maximum velocity [m/s], usually >= 0.
  /// '<min_acceleration>': Minimum acceleration [m/s^2], usually <= 0.
  /// '<max_acceleration>': Maximum acceleration [m/s^2], usually >= 0.
  /// '<min_jerk Minimum>': jerk [m/s^3], usually <= 0.
  /// '<max_jerk Maximum>': jerk [m/s^3], usually >= 0.
  ///
  /// `<topic>`: Custom topic that this system will subscribe to in order to
  /// receive command velocity messages. This element if optional, and the
  /// default value is `/model/{name_of_model}/cmd_vel`.
  ///
  /// `<odom_topic>`: Custom topic on which this system will publish odometry
  /// messages. This element if optional, and the default value is
  /// `/model/{name_of_model}/odometry`.
  ///
  /// A robot with rear drive and front steering would have one each
  /// of left_joint, right_joint, left_steering_joint and
  /// right_steering_joint
