  /// \brief A plugin for logical audio detection.
  ///
  /// Each <plugin> tag can accept multiple sensors (sound sources
  /// and/or microphones).
  /// After each simulation step, microphones check if audio
  /// was detected by any sources in the world.
  /// No audio is actually played to an audio device
  /// such as speakers. This plugin is meant to check if audio
  /// could theoretically be heard at a certain location or not.
  ///
  /// Secifying an audio source via SDF is done as follows:
  ///
  /// <source> A new audio source in the environment, which has the
  ///   following child elements:
  ///     * <id> The source ID, which must be unique and an integer >= 0.
  ///       An ID < 0 results in undefined behavior.
  ///       The ID must be unique within the scope of all other source IDs
  ///       in the plugin's parent element - so, if a source was created in a
  ///       <model> with an ID of 1, no other sources in the same model can have
  ///       an ID of 1 (however, sources that belong to other models can have an
  ///       ID of 1).
  ///     * <pose> The pose, expressed as "x y z roll pitch yaw".
  ///       Each pose coordinate must be separated by whitespace.
  ///       The pose is defined relative to the plugin's parent element.
  ///       So, if the plugin is used inside of a <model> tag, then the
  ///       source's <pose> is relative to the model's pose.
  ///       If the plugin is used inside of a <world> tag, then the source's
  ///       <pose> is relative to the world (i.e., <pose> specifies an
  ///       absolute pose).
  ///       If no pose is specified, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0} will be used.
  ///     * <attenuation_function> The attenuation function.
  ///       See logical_audio::AttenuationFunction for a list of valid
  ///       attenuation functions, and logical_audio::SetAttenuationFunction
  ///       for how to specify an attenuation function in SDF.
  ///     * <attenuation_shape> The attenuation shape.
  ///       See logical_audio::AttenuationShape for a list of valid
  ///       attenuation shapes, and logical_audio::SetAttenuationShape for how
  ///       to specify an attenuation shape in SDF.
  ///     * <inner_radius> The inner radius of the attenuation shape.
  ///       This value must be >= 0.0. The volume of the source will be
  ///       <source><volume> at locations that have a distance <= inner
  ///       radius from the source.
  ///     * <falloff_distance> The falloff distance. This value must be greater
  ///       than the value of the source's <inner_radius>. This defines the
  ///       distance from the audio source where the volume becomes 0.
  ///     * <volume_level> The volume level emitted from the source. This must
  ///       be a value between 0.0 and 1.0 (representing 0% to 100%).
  ///     * <playing> Whether the source should play immediately or not.
  ///       Use true to initiate audio immediately, and false otherwise.
  ///     * <play_duration> The duration (in seconds) audio is played from the
  ///       source. This value must be an integer >= 0.
  ///       A value of 0 means that the source will play for an infinite amount
  ///       of time.
  ///
  /// Specifying a microphone via SDF is done as follows:
  ///
  /// <microphone> A new microphone in the environment,
  ///   which has the following child elements:
  ///     * <id> The microphone ID, which must be unique and an integer >= 0.
  ///       An ID < 0 results in undefined behavior.
  ///       The ID must be unique within the scope of all other microphone IDs
  ///       in the plugin's parent element - so, if a microphone was created in
  ///       a <model> with an ID of 1, no other microphones in the same model
  ///       can have an ID of 1 (however, microphones that belong to other
  ///       models can have an ID of 1).
  ///     * <pose> The pose, expressed as "x y z roll pitch yaw".
  ///       Each pose coordinate must be separated by whitespace.
  ///       The pose is defined relative to the plugin's parent element.
  ///       So, if the plugin is used inside of a <model> tag, then the
  ///       source's <pose> is relative to the model's pose.
  ///       If the plugin is used inside of a <world> tag, then the source's
  ///       <pose> is relative to the world (i.e., <pose> specifies an
  ///       absolute pose).
  ///       If no pose is specified, {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0} will be used.
  ///     * <volume_threshold> The minimum volume level the microphone
  ///       can detect. This must be a value between 0.0 and 1.0
  ///       (representing 0% to 100%).
  ///       If no volume threshold is specified, 0.0 will be used.
  ///
  /// Sources can be started and stopped via Ignition service calls.
  /// If a source is successfully created, the following services will be
  /// created for the source (<PREFIX> is the scoped name for the source - see
  /// ignition::gazebo::scopedName for more details - and <id> is the value
  /// specified in the source's <id> tag from the SDF):
  ///     * <PREFIX>/source_<id>/play
  ///         * Starts playing the source with the specified ID.
  ///           If the source is already playing, nothing happens.
  ///     * <PREFIX>/source_<id>/stop
  ///         * Stops playing the source with the specified ID.
  ///           If the source is already stopped, nothing happens.
  ///
  /// Microphone detection information can be retrieved via Ignition topics.
  /// Whenever a microphone detects a source, it publishes a message to the
  /// <PREFIX>/mic_<id>/detection topic, where <PREFIX> is the scoped name
  /// for the microphone - see ignition::gazebo::scopedName for more details -
  /// and <id> is the value specified in the microphone's <id> tag from the SDF.
