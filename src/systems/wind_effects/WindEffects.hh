  /// \brief A system that simulates a simple wind model.
  /// The wind is described as a uniform worldwide model. So it is independent
  /// from model position for simple computations. Its components are computed
  /// separately:
  /// - Horizontal amplitude:
  ///      Low pass filtering on user input (complementary gain)
  ///      + small local fluctuations
  ///      + noise on value (noise amplitude is a factor of wind magnitude)
  ///
  /// - Horizontal direction:
  ///      Low pass filtering on user input (complementary gain)
  ///      + small local fluctuations
  ///      + noise on value
  ///
  /// - Vertical amplitude:
  ///      Low pass filtering on user input (complementary gain)
  ///      + small local fluctuations
  ///      + noise on value
  ///
  /// The following parameters are used by the system:
  ///
  /// <horizontal><magnitude><time_for_rise>
  /// Analogous to the time constant of the low pass filter.
  ///
  /// <horizontal><magnitude><sin><amplitude_percent>
  /// Fraction of the filtered wind velocity magnitude that is set to be the
  /// amplitude of the sinusoid.
  ///
  /// <horizontal><magnitude><sin><period>
  /// Period of the sinusoid that is added to the wind velocity magnitude.
  ///
  /// <horizontal><magnitude><noise>
  /// Parameters for the noise that is added to the wind velocity magnitude.
  ///
  /// <horizontal><direction><time_for_rise>
  /// Analogous to the time constant of the low pass filter.
  ///
  /// <horizontal><direction><sin><amplitude>
  /// Amplitude of the sinusoidal that is added on the direction of the wind
  /// velocity.
  ///
  /// <horizontal><direction><sin><period>
  /// Period of the sinusoid that is added to the wind velocity direction.
  ///
  /// <horizontal><direction><noise>
  /// Parameters for the noise that is added to the wind velocity direction.
  ///
  /// <vertical><time_for_rise>
  /// Analogous to the time constant of the low pass filter for the vertical
  /// wind velocity magnitude.
  ///
  /// <vertical><noise>
  /// Parameters for the noise that is added to the vertical wind velocity
  /// magnitude.
