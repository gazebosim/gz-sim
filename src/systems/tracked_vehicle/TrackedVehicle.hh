  /// \brief Tracked vehicle controller which can be attached to a model
  /// with any number of left and right tracks. The system should be attached
  /// to a model. Each track has to have a TrackController system configured and
  /// running.
  ///
  /// So far, this system only supports tracks that are parallel along a common
  /// axis (other designs are possible, but not implemented).
  ///
  /// # Examples
  ///
  /// See example usage in world example/tracked_vehicle_simple.sdf .
  ///
  /// # System Parameters
  ///
  /// `<left_track>`: Configuration of a left track link. This element can
  /// appear multiple times, and must appear at least once.
  ///
  /// `<right_track>`: Configuration of a right track link. This element can
  /// appear multiple times, and must appear at least once.
  ///
  /// `<left_track>`, `<right_track>` subelements:
  /// - `<link>`: The link representing the track. Required parameter.
  /// - `<velocity_topic>`: The topic on which the track accepts velocity
  ///     commands (defaults to
  ///     `/model/${model_name}/link/${link_name}/track_cmd_vel`).
  /// - `<center_of_rotation_topic>`: The topic on which the track accepts
  ///     center of rotation commands (defaults to
  ///     `/model/${model_name}/link/${link_name}/track_cmd_center_of_rotation`)
  ///
  /// `<tracks_separation>`: Distance between tracks, in meters. Required
  ///   parameter.
  ///
  /// `<track_height>`: Height of the tracks, in meters (used for computing
  /// odometry). Required parameter.
  ///
  /// `<steering_efficiency>`: Initial steering efficiency. Defaults to 0.5.
  ///
  /// `<debug>` If 1, the system will output debugging info and visualizations.
  ///   Defaults to 0.
  ///
  /// `<linear_velocity>`: Limiter of linear velocity of the vehicle. Please
  /// note that the tracks can each have their own speed limitations. If the
  /// element is not specified, the velocities etc. have no implicit limits.
  /// - `<min_velocity>`/`<max_velocity>` Min/max velocity of the vehicle (m/s).
  ///     If not specified, the velocity is not limited (however the physics
  ///     will, in the end, have some implicit limit).
  /// - `<min_acceleration>`/`<max_acceleration>` Min/max acceleration of the
  ///     vehicle (m/s^2). If not specified, the acceleration is not limited
  ///     (however the physics will, in the end, have some implicit limit).
  /// - `<min_jerk>`/`<max_jerk>` Min/max jerk of the vehicle (m/s^3). If not
  ///     specified, the acceleration is not limited (however the physics will,
  ///     in the end, have some implicit limit).
  ///
  /// `<angular_velocity>`: Limiter of angular velocity of the vehicle. Please
  /// note that the tracks can each have their own speed limitations. If the
  /// element is not specified, the velocities etc. have no implicit limits.
  /// - `<min_velocity>`/`<max_velocity>` Min/max velocity of the vehicle
  ///     (rad/s). If not specified, the velocity is not limited (however the
  ///      physics will, in the end, have some implicit limit).
  /// - `<min_acceleration>`/`<max_acceleration>` Min/max acceleration of the
  ///     vehicle (rad/s^2). If not specified, the velocity is not limited
  ///     (however the physics will, in the end, have some implicit limit).
  /// - `<min_jerk>`/`<max_jerk>` Min/max jerk of the vehicle (rad/s^3). If not
  ///     specified, the velocity is not limited (however the physics
  ///     will, in the end, have some implicit limit).
  ///
  /// `<odom_publish_frequency>`: Odometry publication frequency. This
  /// element is optional, and the default value is 50Hz.
  ///
  /// `<topic>`: Custom topic that this system will subscribe to in order to
  /// receive command velocity messages. This element is optional, and the
  /// default value is `/model/{model_name}/cmd_vel`.
  ///
  /// `<steering_efficiency_topic>`: Custom topic that this system will
  /// subscribe to in order to receive steering efficiency messages.
  /// This element is optional, and the default value is
  /// `/model/{model_name}/steering_efficiency`.
  ///
  /// `<odom_topic>`: Custom topic on which this system will publish odometry
  /// messages. This element is optional, and the default value is
  /// `/model/{model_name}/odometry`.
  ///
  /// `<tf_topic>`: Custom topic on which this system will publish the
  /// transform from `frame_id` to `child_frame_id`. This element is optional,
  ///  and the default value is `/model/{model_name}/tf`.
  ///
  /// `<frame_id>`: Custom `frame_id` field that this system will use as the
  /// origin of the odometry transform in both the `<tf_topic>`
  /// `ignition.msgs.Pose_V` message and the `<odom_topic>`
  /// `ignition.msgs.Odometry` message. This element if optional, and the
  /// default value is `{model_name}/odom`.
  ///
  /// `<child_frame_id>`: Custom `child_frame_id` that this system will use as
  /// the target of the odometry trasnform in both the `<tf_topic>`
  /// `ignition.msgs.Pose_V` message and the `<odom_topic>`
  /// `ignition.msgs.Odometry` message. This element if optional,
  ///  and the default value is `{model_name}/{link_name}`.
