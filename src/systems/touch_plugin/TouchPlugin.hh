  /// \brief Plugin which checks if a model has touched some specific target
  /// for a given time continuously and exclusively. After the touch is
  /// completed, the plugin is disabled. It can be re-enabled through an
  /// Ignition transport service.
  ///
  /// It requires that contact sensors be placed in at least one link on the
  /// model on which this plugin is attached.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  ///
  /// <target> Scoped name of the desired collision entity that is checked to
  ///          see if it's touching this model. This can be a substring of the
  ///          desired collision name so we match more than one collision. For
  ///          example, using the name of a model will match all its collisions.
  ///
  /// <time> Target time in seconds to maintain contact.
  ///
  /// <namespace> Namespace for transport topics/services:
  ///             /<namespace>/enable : Service used to enable and disable the
  ///                                   plugin.
  ///             /<namespace>/touched : Topic where a message is published once
  ///                                    the touch event occurs.
