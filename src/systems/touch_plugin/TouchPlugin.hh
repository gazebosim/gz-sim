  /// \brief Plugin which publishes a message if the model it is attached
  /// to has touched one or more specified targets continuously during a
  /// given time.
  ///
  /// After publishing, the plugin is disabled. It can be re-enabled through
  /// a Gazebo Transport service call.
  ///
  /// The plugin requires that a contact sensors is placed in at least one
  /// link on the model on which this plugin is attached.
  ///
  /// Parameters:
  ///
  /// - `<target>` Name, or substring of a name, that identifies the target
  ///              collision entity/entities.
  ///              This value is searched in the scoped name of all collision
  ///              entities, so it can possibly match more than one collision.
  ///              For example, using the name of a model will match all of its
  ///              collisions (scoped name
  ///              /model_name/link_name/collision_name).
  ///
  /// - `<time>` Target time in seconds to maintain contact.
  ///
  /// - `<namespace>` Namespace for transport topics/services:
  ///             + `/<namespace>/enable` : Service used to enable and disable
  ///                                       the plugin.
  ///             + `/<namespace>/touched` : Topic where a message is published
  ///                                        once the touch event occurs.
  ///
  /// - `<enabled>` Set this to true so the plugin works from the start and
  ///               doesn't need to be enabled.
