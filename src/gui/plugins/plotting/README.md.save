## Ignition Plotting
  
### Build
mkdir build
cd build


  
### Run Gazebo Plugin
* Run the Testing Publisher
```bash
cd publisher/build
./publisher
```
* Run the Plugin
./run for copying the plugin to $IGN_GUI_PLUGIN_PATH and to run the plot.sdf in ignition gazebo
```bash
cd gazebo_plotting/build
./run
```
* Run the Keyboard to control the blue car
```bash
cd keyboard/build
./keyboard ../keyboard.sdf
```
done !


### Run Gui Plugin
```bash
cd gui_plotting/build/
./run
```

this will raise the error of undifined symbol as the modification of the Plotting interface is here in the gui plugin and not in the gazebo plugin
