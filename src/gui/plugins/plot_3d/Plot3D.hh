  /// \brief Plot the trajectory of an entity into the 3D scene.
  ///
  /// This plugin can be instantiated multiple times to plot various entities.
  ///
  /// The plugin is automatically attached to the currently selected entity,
  /// unless it is locked on an entity.
  ///
  /// ## Configuration
  ///
  /// * `<entity_name>` (optional): Plot the given entity at startup. Accepts
  /// names scoped with `::`, for example `my_model::my_link`. If not provided,
  /// the plugin starts not attached to any entity, and will attach to the
  /// next selected entity.
  ///
  /// * `<color>` (optional): RGB color of line, defaults to blue.
  ///
  /// * `<offset>` (optional): XYZ offset from the entity's origin to plot from,
  /// expressed in the entity's frame. Defaults to zero.
  ///
  /// * `<minimum_distance>` (optional): The minimum distance between points to
  /// plot. A new point will not be plotted until the entity has moved beyond
  /// this distance from the previous point. Defaults to 5 cm.
  ///
  /// * `<maximum_points> (optional)`: Maximum number of points on the plot.
  /// After this number is reached, the older points start being deleted.
  /// Defaults to 1000.
