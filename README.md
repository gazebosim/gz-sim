Gazebo Sim is an open source robotics simulator. Through Gazebo Sim, users have access to high fidelity physics, rendering, and sensor models. Additionally, users and developers have multiple points of entry to simulation including a graphical user interface, plugins, and asynchronous message passing and services.

Gazebo Sim is derived from [Gazebo Classic](http://classic.gazebosim.org) and represents over 16 years of development and experience in robotics and simulation. This library is part of the [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org) project.

# Features

* **Dynamics simulation**: Access multiple high-performance physics engines
through
[Gazebo Physics](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-physics).

* **Advanced 3D graphics**: Through
[Gazebo Rendering](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-rendering),
it's possible to use rendering engines such as OGRE v2 for realistic rendering
of environments with high-quality lighting, shadows, and textures.

* **Sensors and noise models**: Generate sensor data, optionally with noise,
from laser range finders, 2D/3D cameras, Kinect style sensors, contact sensors,
force-torque, IMU, GPS, and more, all powered by
[Gazebo Sensors](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sensors)

* **Plugins**: Develop custom plugins for robot, sensor, and
environment control.

* **Graphical interface**: Create, introspect and interact with your simulations
through plugin-based graphical interfaces powered by
[Gazebo GUI](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-gui).

* **Simulation models**: Access numerous robots including PR2, Pioneer2 DX,
iRobot Create, and TurtleBot, and construct environments using other physically
accurate models available through
[Gazebo Fuel](https://app.gazebosim.org/fuel). You can also build a
new model using [SDF](http://sdformat.org).

* **TCP/IP Transport**: Run simulation on remote servers and interface to
Gazebo Sim through socket-based message passing using
[Gazebo Transport](https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-transport).

* **Command line tools**: Extensive command line tools for increased simulation
introspection and control.

# Install

See the [installation tutorial](https://gazebosim.org/api/gazebo/6.1/install.html).

# Usage

Gazebo Sim can be run from the command line, once [installed](#install), using:

```
gz sim
```

For help, and command line options use:

```
gz sim -h
```

## Known issue of command line tools

In the event that the installation is a mix of Debian and from source, command
line tools from `gz-tools` may not work correctly.

A workaround for a single package is to define the environment variable
`GZ_CONFIG_PATH` to point to the location of the Gazebo library installation,
where the YAML file for the package is found, such as
```
export GZ_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/share/gz
```

However, that environment variable only takes a single path, which means if the
installations from source are in different locations, only one can be specified.

Another workaround for working with multiple Gazebo libraries on the command
line is using symbolic links to each library's YAML file.
```
mkdir ~/.gz/tools/configs -p
cd ~/.gz/tools/configs/
ln -s /usr/local/share/gz/fuel8.yaml .
ln -s /usr/local/share/gz/transport12.yaml .
ln -s /usr/local/share/gz/transportlog12.yaml .
...
export GZ_CONFIG_PATH=$HOME/.gz/tools/configs
```
