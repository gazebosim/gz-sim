# Distributed simulation demo

This demo shows how to run a simulation that is distributed across several
processes or even machines.

## Try it out

1. Build the test distribution worlds TODO(louise) create worlds specific for the demo

1. On one terminal, start the simulation primary:

        . ./primary.sh

    TODO: explain what should happen at this point

1. On another terminal, start a simulation secondary:

        . ./secondary.sh

    TODO: explain what should happen at this point


1. TODO: a compelling example should have at least 2 secondaries, which are synced via the primary.
