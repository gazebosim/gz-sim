# Custom Rendering Sensor

This is a very basic, incomplete class that's meant to demonstrate custom rendering sensors in Gazebo.

It attempts to implement the suggestions offered on Issue #1673:
[https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sim/issues/1673]

All the code is untested due to my inability to provide a proper testing environment at this time.
No CMakeLists.txt file is included with this directory due to my lack of knowledge of CMake.
Apologies in advance for the likely non-functional code.
I am not very experienced with the tools used in this development stack.

## Build
