\page model_command Model Command

## Overview
`ign model` command allows you to get information about the models for a given running Ignition Gazebo simulation.

For each model, it is possible to get information about its
 -  Pose: Pose of the model
 -  Links: Pose, mass, and inertial matrix of the link
 -  Joints: Parent link, child link and joint type.

## Example running the diff_drive world

To try out this command we need first a running simulation. Let's load the `diff_drive` example world. In a terminal, run:

    ign gazebo diff_drive.sdf

Once Ignition Gazebo is up, we can use the ign model command to get information of the simulation.
Open a new terminal and enter:

    ign model --list

And available models should be printed:


    Available models:
        - ground_plane
        - vehicle_blue
        - vehicle_green

Once you get the name of the model you want to see, you may run the following commands to get its properties.

`ign model -m <model_name>` to get the **complete information of the model**. e.g.

    ign model -m vehicle_blue

```
