\page detachablejoints Detachable Joints

The `DetachableJoint` system allows two models to start off rigidly attached
and then get detached during simulation by publishing to a topic. The system
internally uses a fixed joint between two links, each belonging to two separate
models. Because the system uses joints to connect models, the resulting
kinematic topology has to be a tree, i.e., kinematic loops are not currently
supported. This affects the choice of the parent link, and therefore, the
parent model, which is the model that contains the `DetachableJoint` system.

For example, [detachable_joint.sdf](https://bitbucket.org/ignitionrobotics/ign-gazebo/src/default/examples/worlds/detachable_joint.sdf)
demonstrates a four wheel vehicle that holds three objects that are later
detached from the vehicle. As seen in this example, the parent model is the
vehicle. The kinematic topology is the following.

```
world---vehicle_blue---B1
                    \
                      ---B2
                      \
                        ---B3
```
If the objects were each parent models, instead, there would be multiple
kinematic loops, as shown below.

```
world---B1---vehicle_blue
     \      /   /
       ---B2   /
       \      /
         ---B3
```

Due to a limitation in the implementation of this system, if detached models
need to collide with a parent model or other detached models that have the same
parent, the parent model needs to have `<self_collide>` set to true. However,
due to an issue in DART, the default physics engine, it is important that none of the parent
or child models be in collision in their initial (attached) state.

The system has the following parameters:

* parent_link: Name of the link in the model containing this system that will be
used as the parent link in the detachable joint.

* child_model: The name of the model containing the child link in the detachable
joint.

* child_model_link:  Name of the link in the child_model that will be used
as the child link in the detachable joint.

* topic (optional): Topic name to be used for detaching connections. If empty,
a default topic will be created with a pattern
`/model/<model_name>/detachable_joint/detach`.
