\page log Logging

Ignition records two types of information to files:

* Console messages
    * From the server process only, not the GUI
    * Logged to a plain-text `server_console.log` file
    * Always recorded
* Simulation state
    * Entity poses, insertion and deletion
    * Logged to an [Ignition Transport `state.tlog` file](https://ignitionrobotics.org/api/transport/7.0/logging.html)
    * Recording must be enabled from the command line or the C++ API
    * Can be played back using the command line or the C++ API

## Record

### From command line

Run the example world with `--record` flag. This records data to a default
path, i.e. `~/.ignition/gazebo/log/<timestamp>`:

`ign gazebo -v 4 -r --record pose_publisher.sdf`

A custom path can be specified for recorded files through the `--record-path`
flag. When `--record-path` is specified, `--record` does not need to be
separately specified:

`ign gazebo -v 4 -r --record-path ./foo pose_publisher.sdf `

Other options for recording:

* `--record-resources`: Models and textures can be recorded, in addition to
                        states, by specifying this flag. This implicitly
                        enables `--record` flag.

* `--log-overwrite`: If the record path already exists, overwrite it. Defaults to
                     false, in which case it's recorded to the given path with
                     a number appended (i.e. `/tmp/log(1)`, `/tmp/log(2)`...).

* `--log-compress`: Compress the recorded file.

### From C++ API

All features available through the command line are also available through
[ignition::gazebo::ServerConfig](https://ignitionrobotics.org/api/gazebo/2.0/classignition_1_1gazebo_1_1ServerConfig.html).
When instantiating a server programmatically, logging options can be passed
to the constructor, for example:

```
ignition::gazebo::ServerConfig serverConfig;
serverConfig.SetUseLogRecord(true);
serverConfig.SetLogRecordPath("custom_path");

ignition::gazebo::Server server(serverConfig);
```

### From plugin in SDF

Recording can be specified in the SDF, under `<world>` tag:

```{.xml}
<world name="default">
    ...
    <plugin
      filename="ignition-gazebo-log-system"
      name="ignition::gazebo::systems::LogRecord">
      <!--
         Deprecated: Specifying the path on SDF is deprecated on Blueprint and
         Citadel, and will be removed on Dome. Use one of the other methods to
         speficy the path instead.
      -->
      <!--path>/tmp/log</path-->
    </plugin>
    ...
</world>
```

Use of `<path>` results in the console log and state recording being written
to different locations. Existing paths are overwritten by default. See below.

Currently, it is enforced that only one recording instance is allowed to
start during a Gazebo run.

### Record path

The final record path will depend on a few options:

* If state recording is not enabled, only the console log is recorded to
  `~/.ignition/gazebo/log/<timestamp>`.
* If only `--record`, all files are recorded to
  `~/.ignition/gazebo/log/<timestamp>`.
* If `--record-path` is specified:
    * If the path doesn't exist, logs are recorded there.
    * If the path exists:
        * If no `--log-overwrite`, logs are recorded to a new path with a number
          appended, i.e. `/tmp/log(1)`, `/tmp/log(2)`...
        * If `--log-overwrite`, the directory is cleared and logs recorded to it.
* If `<path>` in SDF (deprecated, not recommended):
    * It will be used unless the path is specified through the command line or API.
    * The SDF doesn't affect the console log, so that file will still go to the
      timestamped directory.
    * If the path exists, it will always be overwritten and there's no way to
      disable this behaviour.

## Playback

### From command line

Playback can be triggered by `--playback` command line flag. `<path>` is the
directory specified to record:

`ign gazebo -r -v 4 --playback <path>`


### From plugin in SDF

Alternatively, playback can be specified in an SDF file. See example file
`examples/worlds/log_playback.sdf`:

```{.xml}
<world name="default">
    ...
    <plugin
      filename='ignition-gazebo-log-system'
      name='ignition::gazebo::systems::LogPlayback'>
      <path>/tmp/log</path>
    </plugin>
    ...
</world>
```

\note The physics plugin should not be specified in the SDF. If specified,
it will be automatically removed so that physics does not clash with the
recorded poses.

\note If both a world file `<file>` and `--playback <path>` are
specified, an error is printed. This is not allowed, because the world file
may be a very different world from the one that was recorded.

## Known issues

* When using command-line playback there is currently a small caveat.
In the case that the recorded file uses `ogre2`, the playback appears
brighter, because the default SDF that is loaded by Server.cc for playback
uses `ogre`.

* Currently, specifying record and playback at the same time is not allowed.
We may support this in the future, to support cropping a recording or
changing the encoding.
